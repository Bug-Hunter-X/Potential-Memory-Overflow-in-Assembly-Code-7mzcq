mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4]

This instruction attempts to access memory at the address calculated by ebx + ecx * 4.  If ecx is a very large number, the result of this calculation could overflow, leading to an access of memory outside the allocated space for the program. This would cause a segmentation fault or other unexpected behavior.
